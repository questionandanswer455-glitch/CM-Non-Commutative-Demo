# CM-Non-Commutative-Demo

### Reclaiming Non-Commutativity from Quantum Mechanics

This repository provides a minimal, one-click demonstration of **Cognitional Mechanics (CM)**. It proves that non-commutative computation—the idea that the order of operations fundamentally changes the outcome—is a structural resource for intelligence that can be fully operationalized on classical hardware.

## Core Message
- **Order is Everything**: Intelligence is an order-sensitive system.
- **Quantum is Optional**: Non-commutativity does not require physical quantization, entanglement, or probabilistic wave-function collapse.
- **Deterministic Logic**: This is a purely algebraic implementation of reasoning using standard linear algebra (NumPy).

## Theoretical Foundation
This implementation is based on the comparative analysis and foundational framework established in:

1. **Comparative Analysis of Cognitional Mechanics and Quantum Computation: A Structural Approach** DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.18066127](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18066127)
   
2. **Foundations of Cognitional Mechanics** DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.18005554](https://zenodo.org/records/18005554)

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cm_demo.py
