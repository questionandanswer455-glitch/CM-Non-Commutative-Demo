# CM-Non-Commutative-Demo

### Reclaiming Non-Commutativity from Quantum Mechanics

This repository provides a minimal, one-click demonstration of **Cognitional Mechanics (CM)**. It proves that non-commutative computation—the idea that the order of operations fundamentally changes the outcome—is a structural resource for intelligence that can be fully operationalized on classical hardware.

## [Conceptual Clarification]
**This repository is NOT a demonstration of ordinary matrix non‑commutativity.** It illustrates the core axiom of Cognitional Mechanics: **intelligence itself is a non‑commutative system.**

Order of operations is not a mathematical curiosity but the fundamental structure of reasoning, attention, and meaning generation. The NumPy demo provided here is a minimal classical analogue showing that CM’s non‑commutativity does not depend on physical quantum mechanics. It is a substrate-independent structural property of intelligence.

## Core Message
* **Order is Everything**: Intelligence is an order-sensitive system. The sequence of information processing defines the semantic state.
* **Quantum is Optional**: Non-commutativity does not require physical quantization, entanglement, or probabilistic wave-function collapse.
* **Deterministic Logic**: This is a purely algebraic implementation of reasoning using standard linear algebra (NumPy). It is repeatable, verifiable, and noise-free.
